# MemoryMosaic

MemoryMosaic is a web application designed to preserve and organize personal memories through a clean and visually engaging interface. The project focuses on user-specific data handling, structured frontend design, and secure access using authentication.

## Overview
MemoryMosaic allows users to log in and manage their own collection of memories. Each user has isolated access to their content, ensuring privacy and ownership. The application is built with a modular file structure, separating concerns across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Features
- User authentication using Firebase (Google Sign-In)
- User-specific memory storage and access
- Image upload and gallery view
- Clean and responsive user interface
- Scalable architecture suitable for future extensions

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Authentication & Database: Firebase Authentication, Firestore
